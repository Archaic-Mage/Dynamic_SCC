# Dynamic Parallel SCC - MPI

## Description

This project is a parallel implementation of the Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm using MPI, where the edges can be dynamically added or removed from the graph. The algorithm is based on the paper "Improved Deterministic Algorithms for Decremental Reachability and Strongly Connected Components" by JAKOB LACKI, University of Warsaw, Poland.

## [WIP]

This project is still a work in progress. The current implementation is not yet fully functional.
