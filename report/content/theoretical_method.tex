\section{Theoretical Methodology}\label{Sec: Theoretical Methodology}

In this part, we elaborate on and enhance the algorithm proposed in \cite{scc_tree_reference}
for maintaining strongly connected components (SCCs) under a sequence of updates. 
The algorithm is designed to accommodate n vertices and m edges as input, proficiently manages the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item  \textsc{Query}(u, v): Verifies whether both u and v belong to the same SCC.
 \item  \textsc{Delete}(u, v): Removes the edge from u to v.
\item  \textsc{Add}(u, v): Introduces the edge from u to v.
\end{itemize}

This algorithm achieves its objectives through the creation and continuous maintenance of a specialized data structure known as the SCC Tree, 
which is further explained in the subsequent section. 
Additionally, it employs an SCC mapping array to facilitate queries in constant time \textit{O(1)}.

The algorithm initiates with an initialization stage, wherein it constructs the proposed SCC tree 
and populates the SCC mapping array based on the identified strongly connected components within the graph. 
Subsequently, the process of constructing and maintaining these pivotal data structures under the delete and add updates is elaborated in the following sections, accompanied by their respective pseudo codes.

\subsection{Data Structures}\label{Subsec: Data Structures Theoretical}

In this section, we delve into a comprehensive exploration of the specialized data structures crucial to the functionality 
and efficiency of the algorithm. Through this detailed examination, we aim to provide clarity 
and insight into the design principles, operational mechanisms, and computational complexities of these structures.

\subsubsection{SCC Tree}\label{Subsubsec: SCC Tree}
The SCC tree serves as a vital component in maintaining the internal connectivity of vertices within the strongly connected components of graph G. 
For each SCC identified in the graph, a corresponding SCC tree is constructed.

The node in the SCC tree corresponding to the label $R$ encapsulates a tuple that can be represented as $\text{\textit{STN}}(R) = \lf( V, E \rt)$, 
where $V$ represents set of vertices and $E$ represents set of edges connecting them.
This encapsulation enables the SCC tree to maintain the connectivity of the vertices that are a part of the SCC labeled $R$,
also facilitating efficient traversal and update operations.

Each vertex $v \in V$ in the \ac{stn} of $R$ is a label uniquely associated with an SCC tree. 
This tree is a subtree of the SCC tree represented by the label $R$.
The SCC tree for a graph containing one vertex $v$ has only a single \ac{stn} represented as $\text{\textit{STN}}(v) = (\{v\}, \emptyset)$.

\subsubsection{SCC Mapping Array}\label{Subsubsec: SCC Mapping Array}
In graph G, each vertex $v$ is inherently associated with a strongly connected component (SCC), denoted by its corresponding SCC label. 
The SCC mapping array effectively captures this relationship between vertices and their respective SCC labels.

Suppose vertex $v$ in graph $G$ belongs to the strongly connected component labeled as $R$.
 In that case, we express this association using the SCC mapping array notation as $\text{\textit{SM}}_{G}(v)=R$. 
 This signifies that vertex $v$ is mapped to the SCC labeled as $R$ within the context of the graph $G$.


\subsection{Definitions}\label{Subsec: Definitions Theoretical}
In this section, we establish key definitions that form the foundation of the algorithms presented subsequently. 
These definitions are instrumental in understanding the intricacies of the algorithms and their associated data structures.
