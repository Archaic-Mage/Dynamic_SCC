\section{Future Work}\label{Sec: Future Work}
The work presented in the paper is a preliminary study and implementation of the parallel dynamic graph algorithms.
The SCC finding algorithm used in this paper is a linear sequential algorithm, which is not very efficient and fast on larger graphs.
We can use any parallel SCC finding algorithms in \cite{implementation} and extend it to fit the dynamic graph setting using the algorithm presented in this paper.
The SCC-tree can further be exploited to make computations more parallel since the it is a directed acyclic graph and changes in the graph can be propagated in parallel.

The combination of distributed memory parallelism and shared memory parallelism can be used to make the algorithm more scalable. 
The underlying dynamic graph maintainance algorithm can be improved to make it more parallel and efficient. 
The future endeavors can also bring in the use of GPUs to make the algorithm more efficient and faster. 
Randomized algorithms can be used to make the process more faster, and efficient methods of synchronization can be used to make the algorithm more reliable and scalable.
